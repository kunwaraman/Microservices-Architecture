#Ribbon
Interview Answer (Perfect)

Ribbon was Netflix’s client-side load balancer used in Spring Boot 2. It was deprecated because Netflix stopped maintaining it and it lacked reactive and cloud-native support.
Spring replaced it with Spring Cloud LoadBalancer, a lightweight, actively maintained, and reactive-compatible load balancer integrated into Spring Cloud ecosystem.

--> Ribbon used static server configuration, whereas Spring Cloud LoadBalancer relies on dynamic service discovery via Eureka, eliminating the need for manual server configuration.

RabbitMQ moves data between services
Zipkin shows how data moved

Interview Ready Answer

RabbitMQ is a message broker used for asynchronous communication between microservices, ensuring reliability and decoupling. Zipkin is a distributed tracing system used to monitor and visualize the flow of a request across multiple services to identify latency and failures.

🔥 COMPLETE REQUEST FLOW (REAL ECOMMERCE ORDER)
-

1.User clicks Place Order

2.Client → API Gateway

3.Gateway authenticates

4.Gateway → Order Service (via Eureka)

5.Order → Product Service (Feign + Eureka)

6.Order → Payment Service (Feign + Eureka)

7.Payment success → Order publishes Kafka event

8.Inventory listens → reduces stock

9.Notification listens → sends email

10.Redis caches order data

11.Zipkin tracks entire request

12.Admin server monitors health

13.Config server provides configs
